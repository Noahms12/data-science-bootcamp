I did this homework in SQLite3 on my mac. The following is the dataset that was generated using chatGPT:

SALES Table
Date	Order_id	Item_id	Customer_id	Quantity	Revenue
2023-03-18	1001	I001	C001	2	50
2023-03-18	1002	I002	C002	1	30
2023-03-18	1003	I003	C003	3	90
2023-03-18	1004	I004	C004	1	40
2023-03-18	1005	I005	C005	2	100
2023-01-10	1006	I006	C006	1	70
2023-01-15	1007	I007	C007	2	140
2023-01-20	1008	I001	C001	1	25
2022-11-05	1009	I003	C008	1	30
2022-07-23	1010	I002	C009	2	60
ITEMS Table
Item_id	Item_name	Price	Department
I001	T-Shirt	25	Clothing
I002	Jeans	30	Clothing
I003	Sneakers	30	Footwear
I004	Jacket	40	Clothing
I005	Watch	50	Accessories
I006	Phone Case	70	Electronics
I007	Laptop Bag	70	Accessories
CUSTOMERS Table
Customer_id	First_name	Last_name	Address
C001	John	Doe	NY, USA
C002	Alice	Smith	CA, USA
C003	Mark	Brown	TX, USA
C004	Sarah	Johnson	FL, USA
C005	Emily	White	OH, USA
C006	Chris	Green	WA, USA
C007	John	Doe	NY, USA
C008	Robert	Black	CO, USA
C009	Megan	Lee	NV, USA

The input and output for each of my questions were the following:
1. 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SALES WHERE DATE='2023-03-18';
5
  
2. 
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SALES S
JOIN CUSTOMERS C ON S.CUSTOMER_ID=C.CUSTOMER_ID
WHERE C.FIRST_NAME='John' AND C.LAST_NAME='Doe';
3
  
3. 
SELECT C.CUSTOMER_ID,C.FIRST_NAME,C.LAST_NAME,AVG(REVENUE) AS AVG_COST
FROM CUSTOMERS C JOIN SALES S ON C.CUSTOMER_ID=S.CUSTOMER_ID
WHERE DATE BETWEEN '2023-03-01' AND '2023-03-31'
GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_ID;
C001|John|Doe|50.0
C002|Alice|Smith|30.0
C003|Mark|Brown|90.0
C004|Sarah|Johnson|40.0
C005|Emily|White|100.0

4. 
SELECT I.DEPARTMENT FROM ITEMS I
JOIN SALES S ON S.ITEM_ID=I.ITEM_ID
WHERE DATE BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31'
GROUP BY I.DEPARTMENT
HAVING SUM(REVENUE)>600; 
{NONE}

5. 
SELECT MAX(REVENUE) AS MAX_REVENUE,MIN(REVENUE) AS MIN_REVENUE
FROM SALES;
140.0|25.0

6. 
SELECT * FROM SALES
WHERE REVENUE=(SELECT MAX(REVENUE) FROM SALES);
2023-01-15|1007|I007|C007|2|140.0
